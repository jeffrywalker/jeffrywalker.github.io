title: "Test Flight: New Electronics Payload With Original Controls"
---

I flew two test flights which confirmed the helicopter was more than capable of safely operating with the additional sensor payload. There was plenty of excess power for fast climb rates and recovery of altitude due to winds. The additional mass attached to the base of the helicopter slows the attitude response which makes the helicopter less agile; however as 3D flight is not the intent, the result is a more stable platform.

**Next Step:** The next flight test to be conducted is with the PixHack sensor payload active and recording at a high rate. The purpose of this check is to ensure the sensor information doesn't include excessive vibrations which could be detrimental to the control system.

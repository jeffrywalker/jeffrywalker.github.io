title: "Preparing for the PixHack v5"
---

For many years I have wanted to work on developing an autonmous helicopter but have constantly put it off for numerous reasons (excuses). Finally in 2018 I made the leap and bought a Blade 360 CFX helicopter. Since then I have learned (with plenty of crashes) how to operate it. While I don't consider myself a great pilot, I *think* I can fly sufficiently well enough to gather some useful flight data. Thus I did some research and I came to the conclusion the [PixHack v5](http://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-pixhackV5-overview.html) flight controller would be the best option due to its built in sensor isolation. Furthermore, I have decided to utilize [ArduPilot](http://ardupilot.org/) as the community has active work with traditional helicopters whereas DroneCode/PixHawk seems heavily biased towards quadcopters and the like.

Since ordering the new piece of hardware I have started to setup my development environment on my laptop which runs on Windows 10.
